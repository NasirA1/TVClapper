How to load USB stick:
======================
First we need to find out where our system locates the device. With the USB device not plugged in, type…
tail -f /var/log/messages

Then plug in your USB device and, looking in the new lines which appear, make a note of the ID – it 
will be something like sda1, sdb1, sda2, sdb2 etc.

Next, we need to create a directory under /media, so you will be able to mount your drive.

sudo mkdir /usbstick
sudo mount -t vfat -o rw /dev/sda1 usbstick
cd usbstick
ls -l

sudo umount usbstick


How to get sound:
=================
1. start-up the Raspberry Pi and let it set itself up (normal set-up)
2. After you have gone through normal set-up:
     a. Log-in as a normal user (debian image: pi)
     b. Type the command: "sudo nano /boot/config.txt "
     c. Press enter
     d. Type in: "hdmi_drive=2 " [exactly as it is here]
     e. Then press crtl + o
     f.  Press Enter
     g. then press crtl + x
3. Restart using the command: " sudo shutdown -r now "
